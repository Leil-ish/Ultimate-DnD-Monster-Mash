# The Ultimate D&D Monster Match

The published site can be found here! https://leil-ish.github.io/Ultimate-DnD-Monster-Match/

This is a little app using the Open5e D&D API (https://api-beta.open5e.com/monsters/) and built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. 

It's designed to help users find monsters of roughly equal ability who can duke it out with each other. In using the app, you'll need to enter your desired battle size and challenge rating (that is, monster difficulty, on a scale from 0-30, with 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 also being acceptable inputs).

These Battles Royale can be a cool way to get used to playing with unusual spells and abilities - plus, if you play as a legendary monster, you're just absurdly powerful (but so is everyone else, if you've used our match-up system, so look out!). If you're looking for a D&D-related night but don't have anyone interested in DMing a one-shot, check this out!
