# The Ultimate D&D Monster Mash

This is a little app using the Open5e D&D API and built with HTML, CSS, JS. It's designed to help find monsters of roughly equal ability who can duke it out with each other. These Battles Royale can be a cool way to get used to playing with unusual spells and abilities - plus, if you play as a legendary monster, you're just absurdly powerful (but so is everyone else, if you've used our match-up system, so look out!). If you're looking for a D&D-related night but don't have anyone interested in DMing a one-shot, check this out!
