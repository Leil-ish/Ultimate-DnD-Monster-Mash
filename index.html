        <h1>Welcome to the Ultimate D&D Monster match!</h1>
        <p>The UD&DMM is a resource for Battle-Royale-Style fights using monsters from the 5th Edition 
            of Dungeons and Dragons. We'll help you match up 2-10 monsters for your game based on their abilities and 
            strength.</p>
        <p>Here's what you'll need to do: 
            <ol>
                <li>Tell us how many monsters you want for the battle (generally, one per player, but you do you!).</li>
                <li>Let us know how tough you want your monsters to be on a scale from 0 to 30.</li>
                <li>Hit the "Roll for monsters!" button!</li>
                <li>Check out the list of monsters and see if you're comfortable with their resistances, immunities,
                    etc. We recommend asking for some extra monsters so you can weed out any options that seem mismatched.</li>
                <li>Battle away!</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <form>
            <label>Maximum Monsters in the Battle. Note: At higher monster CRs or with more restrictions, 
                    there may not be enough unique monsters for everyone in your group to have a different monster.</label><br>
                <input type="number" required class="textbox" placeholder="Enter a number from 2 to 10" id="js-battle-size"><br>
            <label>Monster Difficulty (Challenge Rating), from 0 to 30. Note: 0, 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2
                    are valid inputs, as are integers from 1 to 30.</label><br>
